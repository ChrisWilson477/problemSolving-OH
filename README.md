Hello!

This repo is set up as a database-less, to-do application built using React, Axios, and Express.

Your task is to, using the boilerplate provided, implement the functionality of the application on the front-end and in the server to add items to server-side storage, then render them onto the page.

Goals:

[] implement updateItem functionality to update state with the current contents of the <input> html element

[] implement addItem to fire HTTP request to add item to server storage, then update state on successful completion of the request

[] implement componentDidMount to pull in items already existing in server (items are hard-coded to simulate database call, since server storage will clear with refresh)
